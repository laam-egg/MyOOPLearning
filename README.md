# MyOOPLearning

This repository stores mostly the Java code I have submitted to UET OASIS
and got absolute points (100/100), as well as some notes on them.

## Java Coding Practices

Before diving into doing OASIS homework, be aware that OASIS enforces
several coding rules and practices, which will decrease your submissions'
points if they are violated.

Take a look at the file [`java-coding-practices-vi_VN.md (Vietnamese)`](/java-coding-practices-vi_VN.md)
to view **some** of the rules !

## Troubleshoot

If you cloned a project here and cannot run it in IntelliJ IDEA, you
may try pressing `Ctrl` twice in the IDEA window, then type in this
command and hit Enter:

    mvn clean package install
